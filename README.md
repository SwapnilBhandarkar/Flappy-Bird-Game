Flappy Bird Game Using Pygame
This project is a recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game, developed using the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to navigate a bird through an endless series of pipes without colliding with them. The game offers simple yet addictive gameplay mechanics that challenge the player's timing and reflexes.

Features
Classic Gameplay: Faithful to the original Flappy Bird mechanics where players control a bird and try to pass through gaps between pipes.
Intuitive Controls: The bird flaps its wings and ascends when the player presses the spacebar, and descends due to gravity when no input is given.
Realistic Physics: Smooth physics simulation for the bird's movement, providing a realistic and enjoyable gameplay experience.
Score Tracking: The player's score increases with each set of pipes successfully passed through.
Visual and Audio Feedback: Colorful and engaging graphics with animations, complemented by sound effects for flapping, scoring, and collisions.
Game Over Detection: The game ends when the bird collides with a pipe or the ground, followed by a display of the final score.
How to Play
Start the Game: Run the game script using Python.
sh
Copy code
python main.py
Control the Bird: Press the spacebar to make the bird flap its wings and ascend.
Avoid Obstacles: Navigate the bird through the gaps between pipes. Each successful pass increases the score by one.
Game Over: If the bird collides with a pipe or the ground, the game ends and the final score is displayed.
